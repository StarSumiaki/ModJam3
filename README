## WHAT DO ##

This mod adds a new type of fruit called "Bizarre Fruit" and some subspecies for it.

Bizarre Fruit is occasionally dropped by player-killed Creepers. On its own, it is a food item as filling as a carrot.

Bizarre Fruit can be crafted with other things to create interesting fruits that invoke potion effects:


SYNCHRO FRUIT
	Surround a Bizarre Fruit in 8 emeralds
 
	When consumed, gives the "Synchro I" potion effect for 2 minutes.
	Synchro is a potion effect that gives you buffs depending on the amount of players within a 10 block radius who also have Synchro.
	In general, it minimally takes 5 or more players to gain any buffs. It's a party potion effect!
	
	Note: The hunger level of players influences how much they contribute to the effect so a hungry player is practically useless.
	
	This effect grants Strength, Resistance, and Speed up to a limit based on present players. Each effect lasts 30 seconds so players
	CAN spread out for a while before needing to regroup for more buffs.
	
	Synchro works on other living creatures as well, but the buff is limited to its specific species and is less effective per creature.
	
(SUPER/ENCHANTED) SYNCHRO FRUIT
	Surround a Bizarre Fruit in 8 emerald blocks
	
	When consumed, gives the "Synchro II" effect for 2 minutes.
	Same as normal fruit but expands the radius of effect to 30 blocks. Additionally, consumer can gain Absorption and Saturation.
	
	Note: Synchro and Synchro II acknowledge each other. If Player 1 has Synchro, he'll get Synchro benefits if others have Synchro II.
	If Player 1 has Synchro II, he'll get Synchro II benefits even if everybody else only has Synchro.
	
	It's kind of an interesting design feature. Also, the comment in PotionSynchro.java lies. It's 2/4/6 not 3/6/10. I can't math.
	
ANTIVENIN FRUIT
	Shapeless recipe of Bizarre Fruit, Red Mushroom, and Fermented Spider Eye.
	
	When consumed, gives the "Antivenin I" potion effect for 2 minutes.
	Antivenin provides inoculation against Poison (but not Hunger or Wither). Inoculation != immunity. You may still take a half heart of
	damage. However, it works to quickly negate any poison that you may have in your system.
	
	Very useful if playing Ultra Hardcore and exploring mineshafts or using mods that add lots of poisonous creatures.
	
VIGOR FRUIT
	Surround a Bizarre Fruit with 8 Blaze Powder
	
	When consumed, gives the "Haste I" potion effect for 8 minutes
	Like the beacon Haste effect but portable and not as cool.
	
LIFE FRUIT
	Surround a Bizarre Fruit with 8 Gold Nuggets
	
	When consumed, gives the "Saturation I" potion effect for 2 minutes
	Basically, makes you have limitless energy for 2 minutes. Yes, it's cheap. It's my jab back at the healing system being a nuisance.
	Maybe a future version will add some detriments to it but for now, enjoy some OP fruit. It's good for the eyes! :D
